# Atoms

_Basic building blocks of matter, such as a button, input or a form label. They’re not useful on their own._

# Molecules

_Grouping atoms together, such as combining a button, input and form label to build functionality._

# Organisms

_Combining molecules together to form organisms that make up a distinct section of an interface (i.e. navigation bar)_

At this point we can begin mapping data from our GraphQL page response directly to components that rely on it.

# Templates

_... Templates create relationships between the organisms and other components through positions, placements, and patterns of the pages but it doesn’t have any style, color, or component rendered._

We diverge from Atomic Design slightly by using Components instead of raw CSS, but the principle is the same.
